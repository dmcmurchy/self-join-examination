# An examination of LEFT JOIN on a self-joining dataset

The following data and task is from the PostgreSQL Exercises created by Alisdair Owens. More specifically: https://pgexercises.com/questions/joins/self2.html

The dataset was copied from [Github](https://github.com/AlisdairO/pgexercises/blob/master/database/clubdata-members.sql), modified slightly and then converted into a CSV of the original to import into a Juptyr Notebook.

When doing the above exercise I was not getting the correct results with my solution.

Once I saw the solution provided it became a little more clear on what I had done wrong. I've replicated the exercise here so that I could delve into it further and maybe help others with Self joining tables and the LEFT JOIN clause.
